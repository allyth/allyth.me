            </h1>
            <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Ally, I am based in Chicago, and I have always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and creativity. As an important milestone towards pursuing my personal and professional aspirations, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from DePaul University in 2023, with a concentration in software development and a Data Science minor. At present, I am pursuing my Master's in Data Science.</p>

            <p>Since February 2020, I have been a part of the Visual Informatics and Data Analytics Group at DePaul, where I worked as a part-time Undergraduate Research Assistant at the Data Science Center. In October 2020, I took on the role of Assistant for the Associate Provost for Research.</p>

            <p>In my free time, I enjoy exploring my artistic side through drawing, filmmaking, photography, writing, and playing tennis. I have been fortunate to have some of my artwork featured in local art fairs and poetry pages.</p>

            <p>I created this website to showcase my passion for technology and art, and I hope you will enjoy getting to know me and my work.</p>
            
            <p>Let's embrace our inner limitless dreamers and see where it takes us!</p>
