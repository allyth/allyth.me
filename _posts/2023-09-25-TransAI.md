This experience has been nothing short of enlightening, as it ignited meaningful discussions about practical applications of AI, ethical considerations in technology, and the reflection of our societal values through its regulation. Grateful for this opportunity to learn as well as contribute to the AI community.
I want to extend my heartfelt thank you to my advisors and co-authors, Roselyne Tchoua, Jacob Furst, and Daniela Stan Raicu, for their invaluable mentorship and unwavering support which has been instrumental in making this publication a reality.
I look forward to continuing this journey of exploration and innovation in the field of AI. Thank you all for being a part of this wonderful experience!
