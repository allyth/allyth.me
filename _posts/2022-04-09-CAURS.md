On April 9th, I had the amazing opportunity to present my research in person at <a href="https://www.caurs.com/">The Chicago Area Undergraduate Research Symposium</a>.

During the event, I discussed with judges and students and presented my research work in the form of a poster - <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a6e44117131a536de9f18ef/t/62545d87f4b26432686d7016/1649696136143/CAURS+2022+Booklet_website.pdf"> "Clustering Dashboard for Assistive Materials Discovery"</a> at the Robert H. Lurie Medical Research Center. My presentation earned <a href="https://www.caurs.com/new-page-4">3rd place</a> under the category of Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science.
